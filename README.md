In this paper, we intend to use a probabilistic model: Gaussian Processes (GP), and with the help of GP, we can find the uncertainties in our predictions and get a probability estimate of how the temperature and weather can vary in the future. In this paper minimum temperature, maximum temperature, Rainfall, wind speed and humidity will be considered as variables for prediction since they are some of the major contributors affecting weather change. We only consider a single station's data which is in Cobar, Australia to perform our tasks. The dataset used in this paper for training and testing was taken from Kaggle called rain in Australia. We create three models with different covariant matrix then compare and validate the models’ empirical outputs based on the evaluation metrics. The paper also discusses how the kernel/covariates metrics can affect the models’ outputs and predictions. The results show that the Exponential sign square kernel was able to predict and find uncertainties far in the future but although the Radial basis function (RBF) was good with predictions it failed to predict data far in the future. These models and kernels were particularly chosen to tackle the problem of uncertainty the prediction can also be performed with a simple RNN network, but the RNN does not provide us with the uncertainty measure therefore using gaussian processes was the right method to perform the tasks.
